# Boilerplate to setup an Asciidoc/Reveal project



Writing a full [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentation in a separate file with the [Asciidoc](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/reveal.js-converter/latest/) format is great, but I found the documentation incomplete and the setup painful.

So here is a simple boilerplate. Designed with VS Code in mind.


## Basic demo of the result

[Please this way.](https://baptiste-roullin.github.io/boilerplate-asciidoc-revealjs/)


## Features


- Preset global parameters
- Plugins pre-installed: navigation menu (`M` key to lanch) and full-text search (`Ctrl+Shift+F`)
- Some snippets
- Live reload
- A simple theme borrowed from [here](https://revealjs-themes.dzello.com/robot-lung.html#), with some tweaks and simplifications.


## How-to

1. Download the project.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Install the suggested extensions in VS Code, grabbed from the `.code-workspace` file.
4. Every time you save, the presentation is generated, thanks to the Run on Save extension and its settings in the `.code-workspace` file.
5. To see the result, just open index.html.

## Preview

* For a full preview, launch the Live Server extension.
* For a quick preview without full style and Reveal-specific syntax, use the command `AsciiDoc: Open Preview to the Side`.


## Snippets

- `img`: Add and image. steps: type `/images` , use the path autocompletion plugin  to insert an  image from the images folder, select the path, then launch the snippet. The result shows only the file name, since the global paramater `imagesdir` is set to `/images`. Yeah, that's the easiest workflow I could think of.
- `note` : Add a presenter note block.
- `cols` : Add  a slide with two columns equal in size, using [this feature](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/reveal.js-converter/latest/converter/syntax/layout/#columns-layout).
- `cols-subh` : Add  a slide with a subheading and two columns beneath.

## Know issues

- If you're in that weird tiny minority using accented characters, the search inside slides will work very unpredictably. _HÃ© oui_. Sorry about that.
- Some overlap issues with big pictures.
